# Glowberry-Helper
A complementary resource for Glowberry applications for any modules that need to run in a separate process.

## Defined Commands

## Usage
Using the `gbhelper` is very simple. Just extract the .zip file into the Glowberry Application's main directory (where the files are) and it'll be working.
